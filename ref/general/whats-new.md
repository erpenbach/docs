## Collection CLI
The Collection CLI has been introduced with fine-grained control over collections and synchronizing collection updates.  With the Collection CLI, you can view the status of collections, temporarily deactivate a collection as well as synchronize curated-collection updates. This feature also assists the enterprise manage collections in a Collection Hub by leveraging team permissions in github to authenticate and authorize for a specific Kabanero instances deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Collections 0.2.0
Use the features in Kabanero collections to develop microservices and applications for the enterprise. These collections include enhancements for security, performance, and bug fixes.
* java-microprofile
* java-spring-boot2
* node-js-express
* node-js-loopback
* node-js

Collections are built from [Universal Base Images] (https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi/) and updated to stay current with performance improvements and security currency.  This ensures when applications created with Collections are deployed on OKD or OpenShift the entire stack is supportable with operating system libraries in each container. 

Kabanero now provides an integration point in the OKD management console, making it easy for developers to find which collections are available to them along with a Tekton dashboard to see the pipelines ready for the collections.

## Guides
Guides are now available on the Kabanero website to help you to learn more about Kabanero. Guides provide step-by-step instructions with a real use case in mind to help you get started quickly. See https://kabanero.io/guides/

## Manage microservice composed applications
Kabanero now integrates a new open source project called [kAppNav] (https://kappnav.io/) which is a Kubernetes Application Navigator that assists with managing microservice composed applications. This provides display, inspection, understanding, and navigation of the deployed resources that comprise an application. This is installed through a Kubernetes operator and included in the user experience.

The [Application Custom Resource Definition (CRD)] (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application/blob/master/config/crds/app_v1beta1_application.yaml) from the [Kubernetes Application SIG] (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application) is used as the basis for describing applications.

## Support scripts
The Kabanero support scripts include a sample script that uninstalls Kabanero and must-gather scripts that collect important diagnostic data.

## Kabanero operator, enhanced
The Kabanero operator now includes a â€“targetNameSpaces configuration that defines a list of namespaces that help to manage Appsody application deployments with Kabanero using a controlled set of namespaces defined by the architect and operations roles. To simplify collection development, variable substitution is introduced to allow the same pipeline template to be used for multiple collections. This allows you to use one pipeline for multiple collections.
